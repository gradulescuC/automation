Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
- Web Development (server-side)
- Software Development
- Mathematics
- System Scripting

What can Python do?
- It can be used on a server to create web applications
- it can be used alongside software to create workflows
- It can connect to database systems, read and modify files
- It can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- It can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development

Why Python?
- It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc)
- It has a simple syntax similar to the English language
- It has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages
- It runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written, making it really quick
- It can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way

Python Syntax
- Python syntax was designed for readability, and has some similarity to the English language with influence from mathematics
- It uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming language
- It relies on indentation, using whitespaces instead of curly-brackets to define scope, such as scope for loops, functions and classes,
